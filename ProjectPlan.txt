Weather App: Project Pathway

1. Set up the basic project structure

weather.html, weather.css, and weather.js
Link all three files correctly in weather.html
Push this base to GitHub

 2. Design the basic UI (HTML + CSS)

Add a search input (city name) and a submit/search button
Create a section or card to display weather info
Style with CSS: Make it clean, readable, responsive (use flexbox/grid)
Optional: Add icons or background changes based on weather. 

3. Choose & test your weather API

Sign up at OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI
Get your API key
Read API docs for basic current weather endpoint

4. Write JavaScript to fetch weather data

On form submit or button click:
Grab the user input (city name)
Use fetch() to call the API
Use async/await or .then() to handle the response
Extract data like:
City
Temperature
Weather condition
Wind speed
Icon
Handle errors (Invalid city name)

5. Display weather data on the UI

Create DOM elements or update existing ones
Show temperature, description, and icons dynamically
Format temperature (°C or °F)
Optional: Add date/time of search

6. Add features for functionality

Show loading while fetching
Save last searched city in localStorage
Add toggle for °C/°F
Add weather icons or animations (use icon from API or custom set)

7. Polish the UI & make it responsive

Test on different screen sizes
Add hover/focus effects for inputs
Use media queries to adapt layout
Optional: Dark mode toggle

8. Deploy the weather app

Push final code to GitHub
Enable GitHub Pages:
Go to repo → Settings → Pages → Deploy from main → root
Your app will be live at https://MarkKakoma.github.io/weather_app

9. Additonally advanced features (later on)

Forecast for next 3–5 days
Search by coordinates (geolocation)
Save search history
Background changes based on weather/time
